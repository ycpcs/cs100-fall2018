Course Description
------------------

Introduction course to provide everyone a common knowledge base with regards to programming concepts.  The semester starts with in-class software activities designed to help you develop algorithmic design and problem solving skills.  The middle part of the semester includes in-class programming activities designed to familiarize you with basic programming constructs as well as important debugging techniques.  The last part of the semester includes a design and development project involving one or two people that will introduce basic programming structures using a simple scripting language.


**Prerequisites:**	None<br>
**Credit:**		3 credit hours<br>
**Text:**		None<br>


Learning Outcomes
-----------------

In this course students will learn:

  - To understand algorithmic problem solving skills
  - To determine the operation of computer programs
  - To properly interpret program errors and develop debugging skills
  - To write programs using basic programming constructs in a simple scripting language


Policies

### Grades

Your grade in this course will be a weighted average based on the following weights, and assigned on a 100-point scale according to the table below.

  - In class quizzes: **10%**
  - Lab Activities and Assignments:  **15%**
  - Exam #1:  **25%**
  - Exam #2:  **25%**
  - Final Project:  **25%**

> | Numeric Range | Letter Grade |
> |---------------|--------------|
> | 90-100        | A (4.0)      |
> | 87-90         | B+ (3.5)     |
> | 80-87         | B (3.0)      |
> | 77-80         | C+ (2.5)     |
> | 70-77         | C (2.0)      |
> | 60-70         | D (1.0)      |
> | 0-60          | F (0.0)      |
>

Since the course will primarily be hands-on activities, attendance will be taken at the **beginning** of every class and tardiness will not be allowed.  Each student will be permitted two unexcused absence.  **Each additional unexcused absence will result in a 5% final grade reduction.**

### Quizzes

Quizzes will be given periodically to provide formative assessment of your understanding of the concepts being presented in class. They will be given at the beginning of class. No make-up quizzes will be given without approval of the instructor.

### Exams

**No make-up exams will be given without approval of the instructor prior to class unless proof of extreme emergency or illness is provided.**  The exams will cover material from the topics covered in class.

### Lab Activities

The lab activities are designed to help students develop algorithmic programming skills critical to success in computer science. An important part of these skills includes the ability to recognize and correct errors through good debugging skills. The programming labs will also introduce the various common programming constructs such as variables, decisions, loops, functions, and basic object oriented components through the Python scripting language.  Finally students will undertake a final project to allow them to apply their programming skills learned throughout the course.  The topic will be chosen based on the interests of the students. Further details and topic suggestions will be provided later in the semester.

### Assignments

Discussing programming assignments with other students is acceptable, and encouraged. However, collaboration **must be more than just copying code**; you must **actively contribute to the collaboration**, and you must **write and understand all of the code you include in your program**. Verbatim copying of someone else's code (including electronic transmission or using code from websites) is forbidden under any circumstances. You must actively contribute to the process of understanding and solving the problem posed in the homework assignment.

### Attendance

Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes and read the appropriate text material prior to class.  If a student must miss a class, it is his responsibility to notify the professor prior to class.  Students are responsible for all material covered in class.

### Academic Integrity

York College’s mission statement stipulates that strict adherence to principles of academic honesty is expected of all students.  Therefore, academic dishonesty will not be tolerated at York College.  Academic dishonesty refers to actions such as, but not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, fabricating research, falsifying academic documents, etc., and includes all situations where students make use of the work of others and claim such work as their own.

Academic dishonesty will result in a '0' at minimum for all involved work and possible removal from the course at the discretion of the professor.  A written report of the circumstances and disciplinary action will be provided to the student.  A copy of this report will also be forwarded to the Dean of Academic Affairs which may result in suspension from the college for repeat offenses.  Students have the right to challenge any such actions through the normal appeals procedure.  Students are not permitted to withdraw from a course in which they have been accused of academic dishonesty.

### Professionalism

I expect you to conduct yourself as a professional in this course. Professionalism includes:

-   Respect for and courteous interaction with peers, faculty and facilities;
-   Integrity, which includes at its core honesty, responsibility and accountability for one’s own actions;
-   Sensitivity and appreciation for diverse cultures, backgrounds, and life experiences;
-   Constructive evaluation, which means that criticism is offered and accepted in a productive manner;
-   Self-reflection and identification of one’s own strengths and weaknesses;
-   Responsibility for one’s own education and learning;
-   An attitude that fosters professional behavior in colleagues and peers;
-   Punctuality at meetings and class sessions;
-   Attentive behavior during class sessions, avoiding personal or social use of cell phones, laptops, or other electronic devices;
-   Acknowledgement of the Kinsley Engineering Center as a professional workplace, and treatment of this facility as a business or office space, not as an informal space.

I reserve the right to enforce this code through the York College Code of Student Conduct.

### Use of Personal Technology in the Classroom

While York College recognizes students’ need for educational and emergency-related technological devices such as laptops, PDA’s, cellular phones, etc., using them unethically or recreationally during class time is never appropriate. The college recognizes and supports faculty members’ authority to regulate in their classrooms student use of all electronic devices.

### Communication Standards

York College recognizes the importance of effective communication in all disciplines and careers. Therefore, students are expected to competently analyze, synthesize, organize, and articulate course material in papers, examinations and presentations. In addition, students should know and use communication skills current to their field of study, recognize the need for revision as part of their writing process, and employ standard conventions of English usage in both writing and speaking. Students may be asked to further revise assignments that do not demonstrate effective use of these communication skills.

### Disability Support Services

If you had an IEP or 504 plan in high school or if you have a disability or health condition that impacts you in the classroom, please contact Linda Miller, Director of Disability Support Services, at 815-1785 or <lmille18@ycp.edu> to discuss obtaining the accommodations for which you may be eligible. If you already have an accommodation memo and wish to access your accommodations in this class, please see me confidentially to discuss.
